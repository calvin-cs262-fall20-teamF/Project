# Section 1: Navigating the Home Page

You can use the Home page to peruse the list of eateries on campus and view each eatery's current activity levels (busyness).

Imagine that you are deciding on which dining hall to go to for dinner. You want to go to the dining hall that is the least busy. 
The detailed steps in this section show you how to:

1) scroll through the list of locations
2) check how busy each dining hall is

-- Note there are two similar options here! This will be fixed later on!
3) check max capacity of the location
3) check number displayed underneath Current Capacity

4) choose a dining hall to submit a report for

## 1.1 - Browsing Locations

From the Home screen, scroll up or down to browse through the locations listed. The left side of each card on the screen has the name of the location. The right side of each card contains information about that specific location.

## 1.2 - Finding How Busy a Dining Hall Is

For each location, there is an English-language phrase representative of the location's busyness level.
We use the scale below to generalize activity levels. Each phrase has a color associated with it to make identification easier.
- N/A (no recent reports within the last two hours): Black
- Not busy: Green
- Slightly busy: Light green
- Busy: Yellow
- Very busy: Orange
- Extremely busy: Red
 
## 1.3 - Checking Maximum Capacity / Checking Estimated People at a Dining Hall
Underneath the activity level, there is number that represents max capacity of the dining hall.

Underneath the activity level, there is Current Capacity with two numbers. The former indicates estimated number of people at the loaction and the latter is the max capacity of the location

## 1.4 - Choosing a Dining Hall

Based on the information provided, evaluate and decide which eatery you want to eat at for breakfast/lunch/dinner. To create a report on the current busyness at a certain dining hall, tap the card with the name of the dining hall you would like to report for.


# Section 2: Creating and Submitting a Report

You can use the Report page to submit a report on your perception of the activity level of a dining hall.

Imagine that you are in at Commons Dining Hall during the dinner rush. You want to send a report to record the busyness of the dining hall. The detailed steps in this section show you how to

1) verify that you are reporting for a certain dining hall,
2) interpret the buttons on the Report page,
3) submit a report.

## 2.1 - Verifying the Correct Location

To verify that you created a report for the target dining hall, look at the text in the horizontal white strip directly under the maroon page header.
The text should match the name of the location that you want to submit a report for (e.g. for Commons Dining Hall, the text should read, "Commons Dining Hall").
If the text is not the name of the location you want to submit a report for, tap the back arrow labelled "Home" at the top left corner of the screen. From there,
find the correct location (see Section 1).

## 2.2 - Interpreting the Buttons

The buttons on the Report page are listed in order of increasing busyness, from top to bottom. The pie chart icon on the left side of the button provides a visual indicator of approximate busyness level. The pie charts' white fill is associated with an approximate busyness level (e.g. if a dining hall is a quarter full, the pie chart that is closest to one-fourths white is the best choice).

The text on the right side of the button is an approximate English-language description of busyness level. The text serves to accompany the pie chart icons in helping you make a decision on what button to press. For example, if you perceive the location as “very busy,” and you see that the pie chart icon’s fill accurately represents the busyness of the dining hall, then the “Very Busy” button is the best choice.

Base your button selection on the pie chart icon if there is a difference in how you perceive the icon and the text. For example, if you think a half-full dining hall is “extremely busy,” then the button with a half-white pie chart icon is the best choice.

## 2.3 - Submitting a Report
1) Press the button that, in your best judgement (see Section 2.2), most accurately represents the current activity status.
2) Press the "Submit" button.

An alert should pop up indicating that your report has been submitted.


# Section 3: Using the Map

You can use the Map page to see where you are on campus relative to each of Calvin University’s dining halls.

Imagine that you want to eat at Commons Dining Hall and need to know the dining hall’s location relative to your current location. The detailed steps in this section show you how to

1) locate yourself on the map of Calvin University’s campus,
2) locate the dining halls on the map of Calvin University’s campus,
3) find out how busy (on a standardized scale) each dining hall is at the current moment.

## 3.1 - Locating Yourself

To locate yourself on the map, look for a pulsing blue circle in the center of the Map page. The blue circle represents your approximate location on the map.

## 3.2 - Locating a Dining Hall

To locate a dining hall on the map, look for a colored pin on the Map page. The color of the pin will be one of five colors: 
green, green-yellow, yellow, orange, or red. The smaller end of the pin indicates the approximate location of a dining hall on the map.

## 3.3 - Finding a Dining Hall’s Busyness Level

Each pin’s color indicates the busyness level at that location as reported by other people. 
We use the scale below to generalize activity levels:

- Black: no recent reports
- Green: not busy
- Light green: slightly busy
- Yellow: busy
- Orange: very busy
- Red: extremely busy
