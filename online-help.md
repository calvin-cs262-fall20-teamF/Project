# Section 1: Navigating the Home Page

## 1.1 - Selecting the Least Busy Space

You can use the app Freespace to peruse the list of spaces on campus and choose the one that is the least busy.

Imagine that you are deciding on which dining hall to go to for dinner. You want to go to the dining hall that is the least busy. 
The detailed steps in this section show you how to:

1) scroll through the list of locations
2) for each dining hall, check how busy the place is

-- Note there are two similar options here! This will be fixed later on!
3) check max capacity of the location
3) check number displayed underneath Current Capacity

4) choose a dining hall

## 1.1 - Browsing Locations
Open Freespace app and from home page screen, simply scroll down or up to browse through locations listed on the app. Each card on the screen will have name of the location on the left side and information about the locations on the right side. Locate dining halls cards by looking at the names.

## 1.2 - Finding How Busy a Dining Halls is
For each location, there is word based on a word description displayed on the right side.
We use the scale below to generalize activity levels:
- Not busy
- Slightly busy
- Busy
- Very busy
- Extremely busy
- N/A: this means no recent report
 
## 1.3 - Checking Max Capacity / Checking Estimated People at a Dining Hall
Underneath the activity level, there is number that represents max capacity of the dining hall.

Underneath the activity level, there is Current Capacity with two numbers. The former indicates estimated number of people at the loaction and the latter is the max capacity of the location

## 1.4 - Choosing a Dining Hall
Based on the information provided, evaluate and decide at which dining you want to eat dinner.


# Section 2: Creating and Submitting a Report

You can use the Report page to submit a report on your perception of the activity level of a dining hall.

Imagine that you are in at Commons Dining Hall during the dinner rush. You want to send a report to record the busyness of the dining hall. The detailed steps in this section show you how to

1) verify that you are reporting for a certain dining hall,
2) interpret the buttons on the Report page,
3) submit a report.

## 2.1 - Verifying the Correct Location

To verify that you created a report for the target dining hall, look at the text in the horizontal white strip directly under the maroon page header.
The text should match the name of the location that you want to submit a report for (e.g. for Commons Dining Hall, the text should read, "Commons Dining Hall").
If the text is not the name of the location you want to submit a report for, tap the back arrow labelled "Home" at the top left corner of the screen. From there,
find the correct location (see Section 1).

## 2.2 - Interpreting the Buttons

The buttons on the Report page are listed in order of increasing busyness, from top to bottom. The pie chart icon on the left side of the button provides a visual indicator of approximate busyness level. The pie charts' white fill is associated with an approximate busyness level (e.g. if a dining hall is a quarter full, the pie chart that is closest to one-fourths white is the best choice).


## 2.3 - Submitting a Report

1) tap the button that, in your opinion, best represents the current activity status.
2) press the "Submit" button.

An alert shoud pop up indicating that your report has been submitted.


# Section 3: Using the Map

You can use the Map page to see where you are on campus relative to each of Calvin University’s dining halls.

Imagine that you want to eat at Commons Dining Hall and need to know the dining hall’s location relative to your current location. The detailed steps in this section show you how to

1) locate yourself on the map of Calvin University’s campus,
2) locate the dining halls on the map of Calvin University’s campus,
3) find out how busy (on a standardized scale) each dining hall is at the current moment.

## 3.1 - Locating Yourself

To locate yourself on the map, look for a pulsing blue circle in the center of the Map page. The blue circle represents your approximate location on the map.

## 3.2 - Locating a Dining Hall

To locate a dining hall on the map, look for a colored pin on the Map page. The color of the pin will be one of five colors: 
green, green-yellow, yellow, orange, or red. The smaller end of the pin indicates the approximate location of a dining hall on the map.

## 3.3 - Finding a Dining Hall’s Busyness Level

Each pin’s color indicates the busyness level at that location as reported by other people. 
We use the scale below to generalize activity levels:

- Black: no recent reports
- Green: not busy
- Green-yellow: slightly busy
- Yellow: busy
- Orange: very busy
- Red: extremely busy
