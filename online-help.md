# Section 4: Using the Map

You can use the Map page to see where you are on campus relative to each of Calvin University’s dining halls.

Imagine that you want to eat at Commons Dining Hall and need to know the dining hall’s location relative to your current location. The detailed steps in this section show you how to:
1) locate yourself on the map of Calvin University’s campus,
2) locate the dining halls on the map of Calvin University’s campus,
3) find out how busy (on a standardized scale) each dining hall is at the current moment.

## 4.0 - The Home Screen
You can use the home screen to look up information on each location, or to go to the report screen. All information on each location is on the corresponding card. 
This includes both an estimate on current capacity, and a rating. To navigate to the report page, simply tap on the card belonging to the location you want to report on.

## 4.1 - Locating Yourself

To locate yourself on the map, look for a pulsing blue circle in the center of the Map page. The blue circle represents your approximate location on the map.

## 4.2 - Locating a Dining Hall

To locate a dining hall on the map, look for a colored pin on the Map page. The color of the pin will be one of five colors: 
green, green-yellow, yellow, orange, or red. The smaller end of the pin indicates the approximate location of a dining hall on the map.

## 4.3 - Finding a Dining Hall’s Busyness Level

Each pin’s color indicates the busyness level at that location as reported by other people. 
We use the scale below to generalize activity levels:

- Orange: very busy
- Red: extremely busy
