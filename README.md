# Freespace

We’ve all heard the saying, “Time is money.” Whether this is taken literally or figuratively, we can agree that this means time is a valuable resource. As humans caught up in the hustle and bustle of the world, we strive to fulfill ourselves every day with a variety of tasks. However, in between responsibilities, we must remember to refuel. Just like time, food is a valuable - perhaps mandatory - resource. With the on-going pandemic in mind, it has become quite difficult to get those quick meals in throughout the day, as public spaces are now limited in number and capacity. 

Freespace, our user-driven mobile app, serves to inform students of the current activity status of their destination so that they may plan accordingly. It is tailored specifically towards Calvin University students in search of an available space in the campus dining halls. The app runs on both iOS and Android, enabling accessibility to the majority of Calvin’s population. Gone are the days of students rushing to class on empty stomachs, as Freespace utilizes a listing of the dining halls on campus, alongside an estimate of their availability to provide real-time data on public space usage. Rather than relying on the current method of checking area occupancy, word-of-mouth, users can quickly access this same information in a few simple taps. Our app collects data from users who are currently located at the specified sites. To do this, the users will report on the present state of that public space on a scale from not busy to extremely busy for other users to see. Freespace blends real-time user reports with previously collected data to provide a community-focused resource to emphasize the importance of finding a free space in the dining halls to grab a meal at just the right time.
