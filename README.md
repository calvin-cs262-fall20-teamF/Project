# Freespace

Imagine how much time you waste in a day walking to a dining hall and finding out that all tables are full. Or when walking to the library and not being able to find an empty seat. The time and energy that you took to get there is now wasted; time that could have been spent on doing homework or catching up with friends. These minutes add up to hours, and can even add up to days of squandered moments. In a society that emphasizes that “time is money,” preventing this massive consumption of time is critical.

Freespace, our user-driven mobile app, serves to accomplish exactly that. It is tailored specifically towards Calvin University students who are in search of an available area on campus. The app runs on both iOS and Android, enabling accessibility to the majority of Calvin’s population. Gone are the days when students scurry around campus looking for an unoccupied location; Freespace provides this information ahead of time so that only one trip is needed. Especially during this current pandemic, public use spaces are limited in number and capacity. Rather than relying on word of mouth, the current method of checking area occupancy, users can quickly access this same information in just a few taps. Freespace utilizes a listing of public areas on campus, alongside an estimate of their availability to students in order to provide real-time data on public space usage. This data is collected from users who are currently located at the specified sites. The users report on the present state of that public space, whether it is crowded and busy, or quiet and empty. The data is accessible through the app, so other users are able to view both open and occupied zones. Freespace blends real-time user reports with previously collected data to provide a community-focused solution for emphasizing the importance of students’ schedules and finding the perfect free space on campus.
